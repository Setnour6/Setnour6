## Hi, I'm Setnour6
I am a man and a student.
I am also born in 2004.

I make and contribute to Terraria Modifications, and I am also a musician, photo editor, video editor, audio editor, and songwriter.
YouTube (and of course, GitHub and Steam) is the best place to contact me, as I am the most active there. Click the button below, or search "Setnour6" on YouTube.

As of the time this profile biography was updated, I am currently working on the Everglow modification and attending post-secondary education.
